### Objectives: 
Have a complete full stack React-Express-Mongo web application running locally.
### Overview
Since I mistakenly provided you with the complete implementation, you have only 3 things to do to receive full credit for this project.
1.  Change the url inside of `app.js` so that it connects to your instance of mongo running on Mongo Atlas (or a local install of mongo on your system).
2.  Add an additional script to the scripts property inside of `package.json` with the `start` property. When you execute `npm start` after making this change it should start your server.
3.  Commit your changes to gitlab.

### Grading
We will be grading your projects by running your application locally on your machine and verifying that it is set-up and working properly. Additionally we will be verifying that you have pushed your changes to gitlab.

### Submission
Submit your application by commiting your code and pushing it to your repo on the university gitlab server. Make sure you verify that you see your code up on the gitlab server after you have pushed it.
